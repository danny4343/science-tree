https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0267143	Multi-methodological approach for the Quality assessment of Senecionis scandentis Herba (Qianliguang) in the herbal market	We set forth to assess the quality of an herbal medicine sold in Hong Kong called Qianliguang by employing a multi-methodological approach. The quality is set by its identity, chemical composition, and bioactivities, among others. Qianliguang (Senecionis scandentis Herba, Senecio scandens Buch.-Ham. ex D.Don) has known antibacterial properties. However, it is poisonous and overconsumption can result in liver damage. Eighteen Qianliguang samples were purchased from herbal shops at various districts in Hong Kong. Samples were first authenticated organoleptically. DNA barcoding at the psbA-trnH, ITS2, and rbcL loci was then conducted to confirm the species. HPLC-UV was performed to screen for the presence of the chemical compounds and to quantify the flavonoid hyperoside. UPLC-MS was used to quantify the amount of the toxic pyrrolizidine alkaloid (PA) adonifoline. Microdilution assay was performed to show the antibacterial effect on Streptococcus aureus and S. pneumoniae. Results showed that five samples were found to be substituted by species belonging to the genus Lespedeza; four samples were mixtures containing not only Qianliguang but also Achyranthes aspera L., Lonicera confusa DC., or Solanum nigrum L. HPLC-UV showed that only ten contained enough hyperoside to meet the standard requirement. In addition, nine samples had adonifoline that exceeded the toxicity standard requirement. In the microdilution assay, samples containing Qianliguang showed inhibition on S. aureus and S. pneumoniae, while among the five Lespedeza sp. samples the antibacterial effects on S. aureus were not detectable; only one sample showed inhibition to S. pneumoniae. Our study illustrated the necessity of using a multi-methodological approach for herbal medicine quality assessment. We also showed that Qianliguang samples in the Hong Kong market were either toxic or adulterated. It is therefore essential to improve the quality control of Qianliguang and probably other herbs in the herbal market.

Tensor decomposition is a crucial task in a wide range of applications and plays a significant role in latent feature extraction and estimation of unobserved entries of data. The problem of efficiently decomposing tensor streams has been of great interest because many real-world data dynamically change over time. However, existing methods for dynamic tensor decomposition sacrifice the accuracy too much, which limits their usages in practice. Moreover, the accuracy loss becomes even more serious when the tensor stream has an inconsistent temporal pattern since the current methods cannot adapt quickly to a sudden change in data. In this paper, we propose DAO-CP, an accurate and efficient online CP decomposition method which adapts to data changes. DAO-CP tracks local error norms of the tensor streams, detecting a change point of the error norms. It then chooses the best strategy depending on the degree of changes to balance the trade-off between speed and accuracy. Specifically, DAO-CP decides whether to (1) reuse the previous factor matrices for the fast running time or (2) discard them and restart the decomposition to increase the accuracy. Experimental results show that DAO-CP achieves the state-of-the-art accuracy without noticeable loss of speed compared to existing methods.

A standard solution is outsourcing the electronic health record (EHR) to a cloud service provider (CSP). The outsourcing of the EHR should be performed securely without compromising the CSP functionalities. Searchable encryption would be a viable approach to ensure the confidentiality of the data without compromising searchability and accessibility. However, most existing searchable encryption solutions use centralised architecture. These systems have trust issues as not all the CSPs are fully trusted or honest. To address these problems, we explore blockchain technology with smart contract applications to construct a decentralised system with auditable yet immutable data storage and access. First, we propose a blockchain-based searchable encryption scheme for EHR storage and updates in a decentralised fashion. The proposed scheme supports confidentiality of the outsourced EHR, keyword search functionalities, verifiability of the user and the server, storage immutability, and dynamic updates of EHRs. Next, we implement a prototype using JavaScript and Solidity on the Ethereum platform to demonstrate the practicality of the proposed solution. Finally, we compare the performance and security of the proposed scheme against existing solutions. The result indicates that the proposed scheme is practical while providing the desired security features and functional requirements.

https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0266910	Analysis of vibratory mode changes in symmetric and asymmetric activation of the canine larynx	Investigations of neuromuscular control of voice production have primarily focused on the roles of muscle activation levels, posture, and stiffness at phonation onset. However, little work has been done investigating the stability of the phonation process in regards to spontaneous changes in vibratory mode of vocal fold oscillation as a function of neuromuscular activation. We evaluated 320 phonatory conditions representing combinations of superior and recurrent laryngeal nerve (SLN and RLN) activations in an in vivo canine model of phonation. At each combination of neuromuscular input, airflow was increased linearly to reach phonation onset and beyond from 300 to 1400 mL/s. High-speed video and acoustic data were recorded during phonation, and spectrograms and glottal-area-based parameters were calculated. Vibratory mode changes were detected based on sudden increases or drops of local fundamental frequency. Mode changes occurred only when SLNs were concurrently stimulated and were more frequent for higher, less asymmetric RLN stimulation. A slight increase in amplitude and cycle length perturbation usually preceded the changes in the vibratory mode. However, no inherent differences between signals with mode changes and signals without were found.

https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0266872	A study on pick cutting properties with full-scale rotary cutting experiments and numerical simulations	To investigate the cutting forces on road-header picks, a series of full-scale single-pick rotary cutting tests on sandstone samples were conducted at the National Engineering Laboratory of Coal Mining Machinery and Equipment, China. The primary objective of this study is to optimize the cut spacing and to verify the numerical simulation results. Cutting forces are investigated under different cutting depths and cut spacings. Cut spacing is optimized by analyzing the specific energy, coarseness index, and cutting force. The rock cutting process is simulated on a pick model using the PFC3D software. Rock samples are used as models, and particle assemblies and micro-properties are calibrated by uniaxial compressive strength tests and Brazilian disc tensile strength tests. The optimum ratio of cut spacing to cutting depth for the analyzed sandstone is determined to be in the range of 3 to 4. The experimental results show that a higher coarseness index corresponds to an increased block ratio, and specific energy decreases under optimum cutting conditions. Forces acting on the pick model are determined by simulation. A reasonable agreement exists between the experimental and numerical simulation results regarding the pick forces. The influence of the cut spacing on the rock-breaking effect observed in the experiments is confirmed by numerical simulations. Therefore, numerical simulations using the PFC3D software represent a reliable method for predicting the pick forces.

Credibility factors of organic food–A systematic review and bibliometric analysis	Consumer trust and organic food product credibility play a crucial role in understanding consumer behavior. The aim of this review is to identify extrinsic factors which influence consumers’ perceived trust in organic food. The research was conducted based on the PRISMA guidelines. During our search, 429 articles were found, from which 55 studies were selected for further analysis. To assess the connection between the selected articles, a bibliometric analysis was done with VOSViewer and CitNetExplorer software. The following factors were identified as influencing the credibility of organic food: labeling, certification, place of purchase, country of origin, brand, price, communication, product category, packaging. From these, labeling, certification, and country of origin are well-researched factors in relation to credibility. The significance of the other discovered factors is supported; nonetheless, further research is needed to evaluate their effect on consumer trust.

https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0266834	Contractility analysis of human engineered 3D heart tissues by an automatic tracking technique using a standalone application	The use of Engineered Heart Tissues (EHT) as in vitro model for disease modeling and drug screening has increased, as they provide important insight into the genetic mechanisms, cardiac toxicity or drug responses. Consequently, this has highlighted the need for a standardized, unbiased, robust and automatic way to analyze hallmark physiological features of EHTs. In this study we described and validated a standalone application to analyze physiological features of EHTs in an automatic, robust, and unbiased way, using low computational time. The standalone application “EHT Analysis” contains two analysis modes (automatic and manual) to analyzes the contractile properties and the contraction kinetics of EHTs from high speed bright field videos. As output data, the graphs of displacement, contraction force and contraction kinetics per file will be generated together with the raw data. Additionally, it also generates a summary file containing all the data from the analyzed files, which facilitates and speeds up the post analysis. From our study we highlight the importance of analyzing the axial stress which is the force per surface area (μN/mm2). This allows to have a readout overtime of tissue compaction, axial stress and leave the option to calculate at the end point of an experiment the physiological cross-section area (PSCA). We demonstrated the utility of this tool by analyzing contractile properties and compaction over time of EHTs made out of a double reporter human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC) line (NKX2.5EGFP/+-COUP-TFIImCherry/+) and different ratios of human adult cardiac fibroblasts (HCF). Our standalone application “EHT Analysis” can be applied for different studies where the physiological features of EHTs needs to be analyzed under the effect of a drug compound or in a disease model.

Because of the significant brittleness and low strength of carbide-slag-stabilized soil, fibers were added to carbide-slag-stabilized soil in this experimental study. The effects of fiber length and fiber content on the unconfined compressive and indirect tensile strengths of carbide-slag-stabilized soil were investigated. The concepts of the density of fibers in solidified soil and the number of fibers in a unit volume solidified soil were proposed, and the effects of fiber distribution density on the mechanical properties of the solidified soil were evaluated. The fibers increased the indirect tensile strength of the carbide-slag-solidified soil, which was significantly higher than the unconfined compressive strength of the solidified soil. The fibers had no significant effect on the unconfined compressive and indirect tensile strengths of the 7 d carbide-slag-solidified soil but increased those of the 28 d carbide-slag-solidified soil. The enhancement effect was the most significant when a 0.3% content of 19 mm long fibers was incorporated into the carbide-slag-solidified soil.

Yet, concerns over data privacy, cost, and lack of secure data-sharing solutions have prevented data owners from sharing data. To overcome these issues, several research works have proposed blockchain-based data-sharing solutions for their ability to add transparency and control to the data-sharing process. Yet, while models for decentralized data sharing exist, how to incentivize these structures to enable data sharing at scale remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we study different incentive mechanisms for decentralized data-sharing platforms. Smart contracts are used to automate different payment options between data owners and data requesters. We evaluate multiple cost pricing scenarios for data monetization by simulating incentive mechanisms on a blockchain-based data-sharing platform. We show that a cost compensation model for the data owner rapidly cover the cost of data sharing and balance the overall incentives for all the actors in the platform.

https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0266564	Can digital finance reduce industrial pollution? New evidence from 260 cities in China	Industrial pollution reduction is a crucial issue in the pursuit of sustainable economic and environmental development. As a product of the deep integration of traditional finance and Internet information technology, digital finance has become an effective tool for regulating the use of funds and strengthening the effectiveness of policies in the context of the digital era, which has obvious effects on industrial pollution emissions. Using panel data of 260 prefecture-level cities in China from 2011–2019 and the digital inclusive finance index jointly compiled by Peking University and Ant Financial Services Group, this paper empirically analyzes the impact of digital finance on industrial pollution emissions through fixed effects model, mediating effects model and threshold effects model. The empirical results show that digital finance can effectively reduce industrial pollution and part of the impact is achieved through industrial structure. In the process of reducing industrial pollution by digital finance, there exists double threshold effects. When the development of digital finance breaks the threshold value, the industrial pollution emission reduction effect appears to accelerate. Finally, this paper puts forward targeted suggestions to promote industrial pollution reduction and environmental economic development.	[]
https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0266499	Social capital, identification and support: Scope for integration	Social relationships are important predictors of a range of individual outcomes, such as wellbeing and health. These social relationships are conceptualised in different ways, such as (inter-personal) forms of social support, identification with groups, or social capital. What is the overlap among these concepts and in what ways do they differ? The present work aims to clarify this with empirical evidence from two panel studies (N = 3934; N = 2912). The studies include central measures of social relationships (group identification, group membership, social support and social capital). Empirical differences and overlap were studied by evaluating the factor structure of the data with both confirmatory factor analyses and bi-factor analyses. Results showed that the different concepts had a large amount of empirical overlap (together accounting for over 60% of common variance). Surprisingly, results also revealed that subcomponents were identifiable based on who they target and not based on their conceptualisation. For example, items about identification with neighbourhood factored together with support items from the neighbourhood, and not with other identification items. Accordingly, we conclude that in addition to a general factor, it is possible to meaningfully distinguish components of social relations based on which group is targeted by the items (e.g. neighbourhood or family and friends). For future research on the relationship between social relations and health, the present measures are unlikely to be sufficiently precise to disentangle whether health effects are caused by identification, support or capital. Differences between targets appear to be more important than differences between these concepts for understanding the relationship between social relations and health and wellbeing.
