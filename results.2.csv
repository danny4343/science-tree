Therefore, artificial intelligence has become a popular tool for the automatic processing of medical data, acting as a supportive tool for doctors. However, the machine learning models used to build these tools are highly dependent on the data used to train them. Large amounts of data can be difficult to obtain in medicine due to privacy reasons, expensive and time-consuming annotations, and a general lack of data samples for infrequent lesions. In this study, we present a novel synthetic data generation pipeline, called SinGAN-Seg, to produce synthetic medical images with corresponding masks using a single training image. Our method is different from the traditional generative adversarial networks (GANs) because our model needs only a single image and the corresponding ground truth to train. We also show that the synthetic data generation pipeline can be used to produce alternative artificial segmentation datasets with corresponding ground truth masks when real datasets are not allowed to share. The pipeline is evaluated using qualitative and quantitative comparisons between real data and synthetic data to show that the style transfer technique used in our pipeline significantly improves the quality of the generated data and our method is better than other state-of-the-art GANs to prepare synthetic images when the size of training datasets are limited. By training UNet++ using both real data and the synthetic data generated from the SinGAN-Seg pipeline, we show that the models trained on synthetic data have very close performances to those trained on real data when both datasets have a considerable amount of training data. In contrast, we show that synthetic data generated from the SinGAN-Seg pipeline improves the performance of segmentation models when training datasets do not have a considerable amount of data. All experiments were performed using an open dataset and the code is publicly available on GitHub.

This model incorporates many realistic features of biological transport process including the length of biological “particles” and the fact that they can detach along the biological ‘tracks’. The flow between the consecutive sites is unidirectional and is described by a “soft” simple exclusion principle and by repelling or attracting forces between neighboring particles. We show that the model admits a unique steady-state. Furthermore, if the parameters are periodic with common period T, then the steady-state profile converge to a unique periodic solution of period T. Simulations of the EFEIOD demonstrate several non-trivial effects of the interactions on the system steady-state profile. For example, detachment rates may help in increasing the steady-state flow by alleviating traffic jams that can exist due to several reasons like bottleneck rate or interactive forces between the particles. We also analyze the special case of our model, when there are no forces exerted by neighboring particles, and called it as the ribosome flow model of extended objects with drop-off effect (RFMEOD), and study the sensitivity of its steady-state to variations in the parameters.

https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0267851	Using deep transfer learning to detect scoliosis and spondylolisthesis from x-ray images	Recent years have witnessed wider prevalence of vertebral column pathologies due to lifestyle changes, sedentary behaviors, or injuries. Spondylolisthesis and scoliosis are two of the most common ailments with an incidence of 5% and 3% in the United States population, respectively. Both of these abnormalities can affect children at a young age and, if left untreated, can progress into severe pain. Moreover, severe scoliosis can even lead to lung and heart problems. Thus, early diagnosis can make it easier to apply remedies/interventions and prevent further disease progression. Current diagnosis methods are based on visual inspection by physicians of radiographs and/or calculation of certain angles (e.g., Cobb angle). Traditional artificial intelligence-based diagnosis systems utilized these parameters to perform automated classification, which enabled fast and easy diagnosis supporting tools. However, they still require the specialists to perform error-prone tedious measurements. To this end, automated measurement tools were proposed based on processing techniques of X-ray images. In this paper, we utilize advances in deep transfer learning to diagnose spondylolisthesis and scoliosis from X-ray images without the need for any measurements. We collected raw data from real X-ray images of 338 subjects (i.e., 188 scoliosis, 79 spondylolisthesis, and 71 healthy). Deep transfer learning models were developed to perform three-class classification as well as pair-wise binary classifications among the three classes. The highest mean accuracy and maximum accuracy for three-class classification was 96.73% and 98.02%, respectively. Regarding pair-wise binary classification, high accuracy values were achieved for most of the models (i.e., > 98%). These results and other performance metrics reflect a robust ability to diagnose the subjects’ vertebral column disorders from standard X-ray images. The current study provides a supporting tool that can reasonably help the physicians make the correct early diagnosis with less effort and errors, and reduce the need for surgical interventions.

To address the problems of low efficiency and poor accuracy of traditional manual inspection methods, a method for welding morphological parameters combined with vision and structured light is proposed in this study. First, a feature point extraction algorithm for weld parameters based on deep convolution was proposed. An accurate extraction method of weld image feature point coordinates was designed based on the combination of the loss function via seam undercut feature recognition and weld feature point extraction network structure. Second, a training data enhancement method based on the third-order non-uniform rational B-spline (NURBS) curve was proposed to reduce the amount of data collection for training. Finally, a pressure vessel measurement device was designed, and the feature point extraction performance of the deep network and common feature point extraction networks, DeepLabCut and HR-net, proposed in this study were compared to analyze the theoretical accuracy of the surface parameter measurement. The results indicated that the theoretical accuracy of the parameter measurements was within 0.065 mm.

Understanding public discussions about this controversy will provide important insights about opinions of science and facilitate informed policy decisions. This study compares public discussion topics about gene editing on Twitter and Weibo, as wel asthe evolution of these topics over four months. Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) was used to generate topics for 11,244 Weibo posts and 57,525 tweets from September 25, 2018, to January 25, 2019. Results showed a difference between the topics on Twitter versus Weibo: there were more nuanced discussions on Twitter, and the discussed topics between platforms focused on different areas. Temporal analysis showed that most discussions took place around gene-edited events. Based on our findings, suggestions were provided for policymakers and science communication practitioners to develop more effective communication strategies toward audiences in China and the U.S.	['https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-020-02765-9', 'https://doi.org/10.1038/nbt.3659', 'https://doi.org/10.1631/jzus.B1800624', 'https://doi.org/10.1080/17524032.2019.1699135', 'https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1212744110', 'https://doi.org/10.1126/science.1232329', 'https://doi.org/10.1111/jcom.12034', 'https://doi.org/10.1080/02691728.2020.1752842', 'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.joi.2017.02.011', 'https://doi.org/10.1038/nbt.3692', 'https://doi.org/10.1080/15265161003743497', 'https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0156409', 'https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0175368', 'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.osnem.2020.100105', 'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chb.2016.04.032', 'https://doi.org/10.1038/srep20058', 'https://doi.org/10.1007/s10815-016-0753-x', 'https://doi.org/10.1002/jgf2.321', 'https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMp1602010', 'https://doi.org/10.1038/nbt.3958', 'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.stem.2016.04.011', 'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.omtm.2017.05.008', 'https://doi.org/10.1038/s41434-019-0088-1', 'https://doi.org/10.3389/frai.2020.00042', 'https://doi.org/10.1109/TKDE.2020.2992485', 'https://doi.org/10.1177/0963662513518154']	PLOS	https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0267406
https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0267171	Software reliability model of open source software based on the decreasing trend of fault introduction	Open source software (OSS) has become one of the modern software development methods. OSS is mainly developed by developers, volunteers, and users all over the world, but its reliability has been widely questioned. When OSS faults are detected, volunteers or users send them to developers by email or network. After the developer confirms the fault, it will be randomly assigned to the debugger who may be a developer, a volunteer, or a user. These open source community contributors also have the phenomenon of learning when removing faults. When the detected faults are removed, the number of introduced faults decreases gradually. Therefore, this study proposes a software reliability model with the decreasing trend of fault introduction in the process of OSS development and testing. The validity of the proposed model and the accuracy of estimating residual faults are verified by experiments. The proposed model can be used to evaluate the reliability and predict the remaining faults in the actual OSS development and testing process.

https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0266600	Study of Asian indexes by a newly derived dynamic model	We take the stock prices as a dynamic system and characterize its movements by a newly derived dynamic model, called the new Price Reversion Model (nPRM), for which the solution is derived and carefully analyzed under different circumstances. We also develop a procedure of applying the nPRM to real daily closing prices of a stock index. This proposed procedure brings a different perspective to the study of stock prices based on thermodynamics, and the time varying coefficients in the nPRM offer economic meanings of the stock movements. More specifically, the average of smoothed historical data A in the nPRM, analogous to the environment temperature in the Newton’s law of cooling, represent an implied equilibrium price.

https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0267702	Awareness, perception and perpetration of cyberbullying by high school students and undergraduates in Thailand	The modern online society requires everyone, especially children and young people, to learn how to use the Internet. Cyberbullying is one misuse that can be detrimental to the cyberbullied individuals’ mental health and lifestyle, and it often ends up with the victim becoming depressed, fearful of society, and in the worst cases, suicidal ideation. The aim of this study is to investigate the awareness, perception, and perpetration of cyberbullying by high school students and undergraduates to find ways to prevent cyberbullying in the future. For this cross-sectional study, data were collected in 2020 from 14 schools throughout Thailand and 4 universities in Chiang Mai, Thailand, using two-stage sampling. Chi-squared tests were used to compare differences between the groups. Of the 2,683 high school students, girls perceived cyberbullying more than boys (81.6% vs. 75.4%; p <0.001), with those from the later academic years being more aware of cyberbullying (p = 0.033) and more likely to conduct cyberbullying behavior (p = 0.027). Of the 721 undergraduates, women were more aware of cyberbullying than men (92.1% vs. 82.7%; p <0.001). The most common cause of cyberbullying was aiming to tease the target (67.6% of high school students vs. 82.5% of undergraduates). The most commonly cyberbullying victimization was sending mocking or rebuking messages (29.6% of high school students and 39.6% of undergraduates). The most popular solutions for cyberbullying were to avoid leaving a trace on social media and be with friends who accept who you are. Our findings show that most of the cyberbullying perpetrators did not consider that their actions would have serious consequences and only carried out cyberbullying because of wanting to tease their victims. This is useful information for the cyberbullying solution center, teachers, and parents to recognize how to make the students realize the effects of cyberbullying on the victims.

https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0267213	Validation pipeline for machine learning algorithm assessment for multiple vendors	A standardized objective evaluation method is needed to compare machine learning (ML) algorithms as these tools become available for clinical use. Therefore, we designed, built, and tested an evaluation pipeline with the goal of normalizing performance measurement of independently developed algorithms, using a common test dataset of our clinical imaging. Three vendor applications for detecting solid, part-solid, and groundglass lung nodules in chest CT examinations were assessed in this retrospective study using our data-preprocessing and algorithm assessment chain. The pipeline included tools for image cohort creation and de-identification; report and image annotation for ground-truth labeling; server partitioning to receive vendor “black box” algorithms and to enable model testing on our internal clinical data (100 chest CTs with 243 nodules) from within our security firewall; model validation and result visualization; and performance assessment calculating algorithm recall, precision, and receiver operating characteristic curves (ROC). Algorithm true positives, false positives, false negatives, recall, and precision for detecting lung nodules were as follows: Vendor-1 (194, 23, 49, 0.80, 0.89); Vendor-2 (182, 270, 61, 0.75, 0.40); Vendor-3 (75, 120, 168, 0.32, 0.39). The AUCs for detection of solid (0.61–0.74), groundglass (0.66–0.86) and part-solid (0.52–0.86) nodules varied between the three vendors. Our ML model validation pipeline enabled testing of multi-vendor algorithms within the institutional firewall. Wide variations in algorithm performance for detection as well as classification of lung nodules justifies the premise for a standardized objective ML algorithm evaluation process.

https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0267211	Identifying luminal and basal mammary cell specific genes and their expression patterns during pregnancy	Mammary gland is present in all mammals and usually functions in producing milk to feed the young offspring. Mammogenesis refers to the growth and development of mammary gland, which begins at puberty and ends after lactation. Pregnancy is regulated by various cytokines, which further contributes to mammary gland development. Epithelial cells, including basal and luminal cells, are one of the major components of mammary gland cells. The development of basal and luminal cells has been observed to significantly differ at different stages. However, the underlying mechanisms for differences between basal and luminal cells have not been fully studied. To explore the mechanisms underlying the differentiation of mammary progenitors or their offspring into luminal and myoepithelial cells, the single-cell sequencing data on mammary epithelia cells of virgin and pregnant mouse was deeply investigated in this work. We evaluated features by using Monte Carlo feature selection and plotted the incremental feature selection curve with support vector machine or RIPPER to find the optimal gene features and rules that can divide epithelial cells into four clusters with different cell subtypes like basal and luminal cells and different phases like pregnancy and virginity. As representations, the feature genes Cldn7, Gjb6, Sparc, Cldn3, Cited1, Krt17, Spp1, Cldn4, Gjb2 and Cldn19 might play an important role in classifying the epithelial mammary cells. Notably, seven most important rules based on the combination of cell-specific and tissue-specific expressions of feature genes effectively classify the epithelial mammary cells in a quantitative and interpretable manner.

This new network framework is constructed and applied to underwater acoustic target recognition for the first time. Ship acoustic data are used as input to evaluate the network performance. A visual analysis of the recognition results is performed. The results show that this method can realize the recognition and classification of underwater acoustic targets. Compared with a single neural network, the relevant indices, such as the recognition accuracy of the joint network are considerably higher. This provides a new direction for the application of deep learning in the field of underwater acoustic target recognition.

https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0267852	Thermo-mechanics aspects of isochoric cryopreservation: A new modeling approach and comparison with experimental data	A new mathematical model is proposed for the analysis of thermo-mechanics effects during isochoric cryopreservation. In that process, some ice crystallization in a fixed-volume container drives pressure elevation, which may be favorable to the preservation of biological material when it resides in the unfrozen portion of the same container. The proposed model is comprehensive, integrating for the first time concepts from the disparate fields of thermodynamics, heat transfer, fluid mechanics, and solid mechanics. The novelty in this study is in treating the cryopreserved material as having a pseudo-viscoelastic behavior over a very narrow temperature range, without affecting the mechanical behavior of the material in the rest of the domain. This unique approach permits treating the domain as a continuum, while avoiding the need to trace freezing fronts and sperate the analysis to liquid and solid subdomains. Consistent with the continuum approach, the heat transfer problem is solved using the enthalpy approach. The presented analysis focusses on isochoric cooling of pure water between standard atmospheric conditions and the triple point of liquid water, ice Ih, and ice III (-22°C and 207.4 MPa). The proposed model is also applicable to isochoric vitrification, by substituting the pseudo-viscoelastic material model with the real viscosity model of the vitrifying material. Results of this study display good agreement with phase-diagram data at steady state, and with experimental data from the literature. Furthermore, this study provides a venue to discussing experimentation aspects of isochoric cryopreservation. The proposed model is further demonstrated on a 3D problem, while discussing scale considerations, crystallization conditions, and transient effects. Notably, the new model can be used to bridge the gap between limited pressure and temperature measurements during cryopreservation and the analysis of the continuum. Arguably, this study presents the most advanced thermo-mechanics model to solve practical problems relating to isochoric cryopreservation.
